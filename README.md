For our project, we decided to make a sunset scene over Royce Hall. 
Our scene features textured buildings, grass, dirt, and plants. The sky is a moving sun and 
gradient that the user can select.

To run the code, simply open the index.html page in browser. The buttons on the left allow the user to
interact with the scene. To change the time of day, the user can click on whichever time they prefer (
between night, afternoon, and day ). The user can also decide to attach the camera to any of the rose 
bush plants on the grass.
